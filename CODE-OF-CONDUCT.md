## Containers Community Code of Conduct

### Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the projects under the [Containers](https://github.com/containers) repository,
and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to
respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature 
requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other
activities to any of the projects under the containers umbrella.  These projects
include Buildah, Conmon, Image, Libpod, Storage, Skopeo, et al.
as found [here](https://github.com/containers). 

We are committed to making participation in these projects a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery.
* Personal attacks.
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses,
 without explicit permission.
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned to this Code of Conduct.  By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers
commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect
of managing their project.  Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team or teams if they are in multiple
projects.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting a maintainer of the project, Dan Walsh <dwalsh@redhat.com>, and/or Tom Sweeney <tsweeney@redhat.com>.


### Containers Events Code of Conduct

Containers events are working conferences intended for professional networking and collaboration in the
Containers community.  Attendees are expected to behave according to professional standards and in accordance
with their employer's policies on appropriate workplace behavior.

While at Containers events or related social networking opportunities, attendees should not engage in
discriminatory or offensive speech or actions regarding gender, sexuality, race, or religion.  Speakers should
be especially aware of these concerns.

The maintainers of the Containers projects do not condone any statements by speakers contrary to these standards.
The maintainers of the Containers projects reserves the right to deny entrance and/or eject from an event
(without refund) any individual found to be engaging in discriminatory or offensive speech or actions.

Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of the Containers maintainers of the
particular project or projects.

This Code of Conduct was adapted from the [CNCF Community Code of Conduct v1.0](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
